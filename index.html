                <p>HI! I'm Michael Johnson, a 22 year old web developer from San Diego, CA. Besides coding, my passions include science, hiking and just about any beach activity you can think of! Im also an avid fisherman, especially for freshwater trout in the High Sierra Mountains of eastern California.</p>
                <p>I have a Bachelor's degree in Biological Sciences, Anatomy and Physiology from California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo.  My dream was to become a heart surgeon but having large, clumsy hands inspired me to take a different route. I've being coding for a little over 2 weeks now and can already tell that this is my calling. I am excited and determined to use my skills to create applications that help make people's lives easier!</p>
